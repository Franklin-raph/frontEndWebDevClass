[1] Box - sizing : Border box => Here all the divs of the html document takes the width assigned to it without adding the padding and border of that div.
but for the case of content-box its the other way around Ref: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playdemo.asp?filename=playcss_box-sizing.

[2] Min - height : The min-height property in CSS is used to set the minimum height of a specified element. i.e worst come to worst maintain this value also it helps in the case of media queries.

Backgrouds
[1] background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(4,9,30,0.7), rgba(4,9,30,0.7)), url(images/bgImage.jpg); Used to apply gradient over an image
    background-size: cover; Used to set the background size of that section in our case the header section
    background-size: contain; This would try to  maintain the height and width of the image it's not a good option for background images but it might be okay to be used cards where the images are not too big e.t.c
    background-repeat: no-repeat; /*Note the background-repeat property has no effect once the background size has been set to cover*/
    background-position: center; This centers the background image
    
Navs
[1] The best way to display the nav items i.e the logo and the navlinks is by displaying them as flex
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between; This add an even space in the X- axis between the items
    align-items: center; This centers the items along the Y-axis

Other display properties
    display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element

[2] flex: 1; This makes an item take up the total width of it's flex. This means flex-grow is one, flex-shrink is one and flex-basis is one percent also note when the flex-grow of a particular element is above one, it means that element would take the flex grow of its siblings times its own

Centering Divs
Note: This block of code down is used in centering a div
.text-box{
    width: 90%;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}

margin: 10px 0 40px; This css property adds margin top 10, margin left and right 0 and margin bottom 40
